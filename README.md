# Production-Line Butcher - Quality Control

## Project Overview
- As the quality control team for an industrial butcher, we are tasked with determining:
    - where our product lines are in spec within 95%
    - where they are failing to meet spec
    - where outliers or offspec items that might be explained by manual errors, camera-read errors, or non-production/operational issues
    - suggestions where we should further clean data assuming that these errors should be removed from the dataset, and what the implications of excluding errors might be

- These goals are met by: 
    - Interactive visualizations dashboard
        - Histograms per Product line
        - Box and Whisker(?) normalized to spec tolerance 
    - Python or Javascript library not covered in class
    - Data stored and extracted from database
    - User-driven interactive visualization
    - Greater than 3x views
    - Group Presentation
